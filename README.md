# MÃ¨todes II

In this repository you can find the 2 programming assignments for my Numerical Methods II class (Mathematics UB). Both were programmed in C.

## P1
Implements iterative methods to solve systems of linear equations. The 3 methods used are Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and SOR (Successive Over Relaxation). Tuning the relaxation parameter for the 
SOR method, it accomplishes the fastest convergence to a solution.

These methods are applied to solve a Partial Differential Equation by constructing the tridiagonal matrix associated with the system of equations.

## P2
Implements a predictor-corrector method to find points of a curve given by a specific set of equations. The method followed is illustrated below (not necessarily with the same notation).
